Here you will find some rules of safe living with the code.

Also, some tutorials that may come in handy and are part of CTS day-to-day.

### Basic Guidelines

#### Naming Repositories

- Add the root of your desktop. The name to be chosen is _ [project_name] _ [repository_type].
```
Example: congresso_analise, corrupcao_captura
```
- If you think one of the subprojects is very important and can be a repository by itself, add with the name:
[Project_name] __proj__ [repository_type].
```
Example: congresso_proj_redes
```

- If it is an infrastructure-related repository use infra_[explicative_name]
```
Example: infra_airflow
```
